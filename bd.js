Most galaxies are gravitationally organized into groups, clusters and superclusters. The Milky Way is part of the Local Group, which it dominates along with Andromeda Galaxy.",

In addition, the Sun passes through the Galactic plane approximately 2.7 times per orbit.[102] This is very similar to how a simple harmonic oscillator works with no drag force (damping) term.",

On Earth, the Sun rises from the east and sets on the west, most likely because the Earth rotates to its east. The Sun is 1.3927 million km in diameter and is 1.989 x 10^30 kg in mass. Its massive gravity allows the Sun to gravitationally attract all the objects in the Solar System and keep them in a stable orbit around it.",

When the original object enters the atmosphere, various factors such as friction, pressure, and chemical interactions with the atmospheric gases cause it to heat up and radiate energy. It then becomes a meteor and forms a fireball, also known as a shooting star; astronomers call the brightest examples 'bolides'",
